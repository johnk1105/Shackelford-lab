## Metadata of Harrop-Archibald (Draft 1)
This metadata table is used to define the attributes found in the spatial files for the University of Victoria Natural Features Study Phase Two University Cedar Hill Corner Property, Garry Oak Meadow and Camus Meadow Area, Finnerty Ravine, Haro Woods, South Woods,Lower Hobbs Creek/Mystic Vale (Harrop-Archibald, 2008). Spatial files with similar attributes and layers were combined to reduce the number of files used. All layers use the NAD83 / BC Albers coordinate reference system. 

Note: Some attributes were not explicitly described in the document or have 'NULL' values.
